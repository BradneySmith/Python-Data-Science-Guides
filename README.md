# Python Data Science Guides

## Overview

Python is one of, if not the most, popular languages for data science today, and has a robust collection of third party libraries for working with data. These include numerical and scientific libraries such as NumPy and SciPy, plotting libararies such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, tabular libraries such as Pandas, as well as many others. This repository aims to provide a guide to each of the most commonly-used Python libraries in data science, as well as providing resources to dive deeper into these packages.

## NumPy

A numerical library enabling fast computations built using well-optimised C code at the core. NumPy offers a wealth of mathematical features, including  tools for vectorising data, linear algebra, fourier transforms, random number generation, regression, and many more. The library is the base for many machine learning and scientific computing libraries in Python, and was involved in the first imaging of a black hole, detection of gravitational wave, and many other scientific discoveries.

## Pandas

A data science library for working with tabular data. Pandas is a powerful tool for working with 2-dimensional data stored in rows and columns, and is backed by the full strength of the Python language. Common operations from SQL (aggregation functions) are included, as well as from other tools such as Microsoft Excel. Pandas is built on top of NumPy and so benefits from the performance boost of C compared to pure Python. [Pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)

## Matplotlib

A plotting library for visualising and presenting data based on the plotting style and syntax of MATLAB. Matplotlib provides the capabilities for plotting many different charts including: bar charts, scatter plots, boxplots, histograms, pie charts, time series graphs, and more. Matplotlib is also fully integrated with Pandas, and so data can be plot directly from DataFrames. Advanced functions are also available for creating animations and 3-dimensional plots.
